### About Me:
I am a 3rd-year writing major at Loyola University Maryland, currently interested in becoming an author. I love writing fiction. Video games, and movies are my primary sources of inspiration, though, rather than literature. In my free time, I love listening to music. During the fall semester of my Junior year, I partook in a writing internship with Mxdwn games, writing articles about current events in the video games industry.

### Education:
**BSc in Writing**  
Loyola University Maryland

### All of My Articles:
- During my internship with Mxdwn games this semester I had the privilage of writing 67 individual game related articles over the course of four months. Due to the sheer amount of articles, a list of all of them in chronological order can find  at my dedicated game article Instagram account.
