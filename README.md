### About Me
I am a 3rd-year writing major at Loyola University Maryland, currently interested in becoming an author. I love writing fiction. Video games, and movies are my primary sources of inspiration, though, rather than literature. In my free time, I love listening to music. During the fall semester of my Junior year, I partook in a writing internship with Mxdwn games, writing articles about current events in the video games industry.
